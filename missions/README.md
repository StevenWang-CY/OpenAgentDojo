# missions/

Curated supervision exercises. Each subfolder `NN-id/` is a single
Mission (see [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md) for the term). Folder name
carries the catalog ordering prefix; the manifest `id` field omits the
prefix (e.g. folder `01-auth-cookie-expiration/`, manifest
`id: auth-cookie-expiration`).

## Folder convention

## Authoring a new mission

See [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §14.11](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for the
full mission-authoring checklist, and §29.1 for the quick-reference
version. Every mission MUST:

1. Validate against [`docs/schemas/mission.schema.json`](../docs/schemas/mission.schema.json).
2. Ship an `agent_patch.diff` that applies cleanly on the pinned
   `initial_commit`, passes every visible test, and fails at least one
   hidden test.
3. Ship an `ideal_solution.md` whose diff would pass every hidden test
   and every validator.
4. Define `expected_context.required` (≥ 2 files) and
   `expected_context.discouraged` (≥ 1 file).
5. Set `expected_diff_lines_p50`.

Run `pnpm validate:missions` before pushing.
